  # would block the downloaded copy. The cask comes from the author's tap, and
  # the file matches the sha256 above.

  # The agents DO need a reload after an upgrade: launchd refuses to start
  # them from the replaced bundle (spawn failed, OS_REASON_CODESIGNING) - seen
  # on the 1.3.0 -> 1.3.1 upgrade. The cask cannot do it (its steps run in the
  # Homebrew sandbox, without ~/Library/LaunchAgents), so the app does: Homebrew
  # quits it for the upgrade and reopens it, and on launch it reloads the
  # agents (`AgentRepair`). The backup watchdog repairs them too, every 30 min.

  # Deliberately WITHOUT `uninstall launchctl:` - Homebrew runs `uninstall`
  # directives on `brew upgrade` too, and stopping
  # com.renacode.cloudmachine.gdrive-buffer kills the rclone that holds the
  # mount: the image only comes back after ~20 min, and an interrupted upload
  # can cost the volume's root directory. The agents are removed manually
  # (caveats).
  uninstall quit: "com.renacode.cloudmachine"

  # Deliberately without ~/.cloudmachine: that is where the upload buffer
  # lives, i.e. backups not yet sent to Google Drive. Deleting it destroys the
  # backup.

    Open CloudMachine (`open -a CloudMachine`): its window lists the
    remaining setup steps for this Mac, with a button for each.
    See https://github.com/RenaCode/CloudMachine#getting-started

    `brew upgrade` keeps the Google Drive mount running; the app reloads the
    background agents when it reopens. `cloudmachine-agent drive-status`
    shows "Agents: OK" once they run the new version.

    Uninstalling does NOT stop the launchd agents or delete the upload buffer
    in ~/.cloudmachine (it may hold backups not yet sent to Google Drive).
    Before `brew uninstall`, run:
      cloudmachine-agent prepare-shutdown
    then remove ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.renacode.cloudmachine.*.plist.

    Full Disk Access is tied to the release signing certificate: grant it once
    and it survives upgrades. Moving from a locally built copy needs one re-grant.
