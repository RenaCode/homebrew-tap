  # The release is not notarized (no Apple Developer account), so Gatekeeper
  # would block the downloaded copy. The cask comes from the author's tap, and
  # the file matches the sha256 above.
  #
  # The cask does NOT reload the launchd agents: the steps run in the Homebrew
  # sandbox without access to ~/Library/LaunchAgents. It is not needed -
  # the upgrade replaces the bundle with new files (new inodes), and that is
  # exactly the procedure after which the agents start correctly. Should the
  # watchdog stop anyway, `drive-status` and the app window will show a
  # "THE WATCHDOG MAY NOT BE RUNNING" warning.

  # Deliberately WITHOUT `uninstall launchctl:` - Homebrew runs `uninstall`
  # directives on `brew upgrade` too, and stopping
  # com.renacode.cloudmachine.gdrive-buffer kills the rclone that holds the
  # mount: the image only comes back after ~20 min, and an interrupted upload
  # can cost the volume's root directory. The agents are removed manually
  # (caveats).
  uninstall quit: "com.renacode.cloudmachine"

  # Deliberately without ~/.cloudmachine: that is where the upload buffer
  # lives, i.e. backups not yet sent to Google Drive. Deleting it destroys the
  # backup.

    Open CloudMachine (`open -a CloudMachine`): its window lists the
    remaining setup steps for this Mac, with a button for each.
    See https://github.com/RenaCode/CloudMachine#getting-started

    `brew upgrade` keeps the Google Drive mount running. Afterwards, check
    that the backup watchdog still runs: `cloudmachine-agent drive-status`.

    Uninstalling does NOT stop the launchd agents or delete the upload buffer
    in ~/.cloudmachine (it may hold backups not yet sent to Google Drive).
    Before `brew uninstall`, run:
      cloudmachine-agent prepare-shutdown
    then remove ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.renacode.cloudmachine.*.plist.

    Full Disk Access is tied to the release signing certificate: grant it once
    and it survives upgrades. Moving from a locally built copy needs one re-grant.
